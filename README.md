This was stated by a student last semester, so I've now created a lookup table solution for simple logic functions.
Namely `AND`, `OR`, `XOR` and `NOT`. As most students only need `char` and `int` I did not build the functions for any other data type.

### TODO
* Better README on usage
* Makefile for `tests/` `generator/`
* Add better code generation for multiple data types (read as: MACROS)
* Add more logic functions and bit shifting
